# Titanic Survival Prediction – Machine Learning Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project uses the **Titanic dataset** to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster or not.  
The project demonstrates key ML concepts such as **data preprocessing, prediction vs actual values, confusion matrix, and model evaluation**.

This dataset is widely used for beginners and academic AI projects.

## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset contains information about Titanic passengers, including:

| Column Name | Description |
|------------|------------|
| pclass | Passenger class (1st, 2nd, 3rd) |
| survived | Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes) |
| name | Passenger name |
| sex | Gender |
| age | Age of passenger |
| sibsp | Number of siblings/spouses aboard |
| parch | Number of parents/children aboard |
| fare | Ticket fare |
| embarked | Port of embarkation |

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Predict passenger survival using machine learning
- Compare **actual vs predicted values**
- Generate and analyze the **confusion matrix**
- Evaluate model accuracy and performance
- Understand real-world classification problems

## 🧠 Machine Learning Concepts Used

- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Feature Selection
- Train/Test Split
- Classification Model (e.g., Logistic Regression)
- Prediction vs Actual Comparison
- Confusion Matrix
- Accuracy Score

---

## 📈 Model Evaluation

The model performance is evaluated using:
- **Confusion Matrix**
- **Accuracy**
- **Precision & Recall** (optional)
- **F1-Score** (optional)

Example confusion matrix:

| Actual \ Predicted | Not Survived | Survived |
|-------------------|-------------|----------|
| Not Survived | TN | FP |
| Survived | FN | TP |
